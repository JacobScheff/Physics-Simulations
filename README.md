# 2d Collision and Fluid Simulations
This repository contains two different projects. **rust-collisions** simulates many particles colliding with each other, while **rust-fluid** simulates a fluid with adjustable parameters. The particle count, screen size, pressure multiplier, fluid density, gravity, viscosity, and energy dampening can be adjusted for the fluid simulation. The collision simulation also contains all of the same parameters that are relevant to it.
*When running the fluid simulation, the mouse can be used to interact with the fluid. The left mouse button repels the particles while the right mouse button attracts them.*
